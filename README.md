<h2 align="center">Log</h1>

we're putting a line of code into Log, the log tells us what is going on behind the scenes when the app is running.

So we're putting a type of log called "i" for info, which tells you certaion information about your application.

We add a tag that describes the log, and we can display that message in the Logcat.

``` Log.i("info", "Button is pressed");```
